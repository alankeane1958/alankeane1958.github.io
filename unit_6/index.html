The group set out on a series of gigs which they kept up for the entire life of the band. The collaboration with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman resulted in a string of top ten hits, not just UK, but reaching international audiences.</p>

				<h2>Sweet Return</h2>
				<p>After meeting The Sweet's former manager and having a pint, it was agreed that reforming the Sweet would be a good idea. A phone call to Mick Tucker and he was in, Steve Priest decided he didn't want to tour anymore, and of course Brian Connolly had died. Reformng and touring, Andy has carried on the Sweet name. Sadly Mick Tucker died, but Andy has maintained the touring, witjh a new line up and the old songs being bashed out to an appreciative audience who remembered them so well the first time round.</p>
